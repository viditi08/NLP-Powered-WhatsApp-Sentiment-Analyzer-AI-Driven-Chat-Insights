# WhatsApp Chat Analyzer Using Artificial Intelligence 

## Overview
**WhatsApp NLP Sentiment Analyzer** is a user-friendly web application designed to analyze WhatsApp chats effortlessly. This project provides deep insights into conversations using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and sentiment analysis techniques. By leveraging the **SentimentIntensityAnalyzer** from the `nltk.sentiment.vader` module, the tool helps users identify sentiment trends and determine the most positive, neutral, or negative participants in a WhatsApp group.

If you've ever wondered who the most positive person is in a group of 200+ members or wanted to track sentiment trends over time, this tool is perfect for you!

## Key Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies messages as **Positive, Neutral, or Negative** for both overall group chats and individual users.
- **Activity Maps**: Displays **Monthly, Weekly, and Daily** sentiment trends.
- **Sentiment Breakdown**: Visualizes sentiment contribution percentages.
- **Word Cloud & Common Words**: Highlights frequently used words per sentiment category.
- **Most Active Users**: Identifies users contributing the most to different sentiments.

## How It Works
1. **Export** your WhatsApp chat (in 24-hour format).
2. **Upload** the chat file to the WebApp.
3. Click **"Show Analysis"** to generate instant results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NLTK, NLP)
- **Streamlit** (for web application development)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **WordCloud** (for word frequency analysis)
